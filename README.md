# 8_bit_cpu
A simple 8-bit processor using SystemVerilog, Quartus and DE10 FPGA kit made as a project for my university's course Digital System.
The processor has 8 9-bit registers R0 to R7
The processor has 6 simple instructions: 
- mv: move value from one register to another
- mvi: move an immediate value given in the instruction to a register
- add: add 2 registers
- sub: subtract two registers
- addf: add two floating point values
- subf: subtract two floating point values
